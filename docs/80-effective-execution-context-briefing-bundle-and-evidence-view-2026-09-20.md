# 80 - Effective Execution Context, the briefing evidence bundle, the autonomy evidence view, and release-state visibility (20 September 2026)

**Status:** the plan for the milestone ChatGPT ordered on 20 September, written before the code, then
the record as each stream completes. Gate 11 attempt 2 stays first the moment the Anthropic bypass
answers 200 (`docs/77` section E); nothing here activates anything.

**Read first:** `docs/78` (the previous milestone and its consolidated report, section D),
`docs/48` sections E.3 (the intersection rule), K (Ask HQ), M (the briefing), `docs/60` (the
boundaries), ADR-030 (evaluation dimensions), ADR-045 (the shadow period).

## A. Joy's direction and the instruction, verbatim

Joy, 20 September, after the move to the new PC: "resume the bordeguna-hq work, take ownership and
make own decision, discuss with chatgpt, use full effort, continue work and sync." Then, during the
session: "we have to speed up, run multiple agent if needs but we have to complete full project ASAP
without skipping anything, with perfection", and "remember it we needs to speed up this project, top
priority."

The consolidated report of `docs/78` section D (with the trace-link addendum folded in as point 7)
was posted to the HQ thread on 20 September with five questions. ChatGPT's answer, in Bangla, in
short: the proposal is approved, and tightened in two places. The typed evidence bundle is the
canonical contract of the Executive's standard briefing, but it is not truth, it is the bounded
evidence surface the narrator may speak from. The Ask HQ authorization finding must not be an M6
patch: it becomes a generic Effective Execution Context, an intersection and never a union, used by
every AI entry point. It added what the proposal had missed: an autonomy evidence view (read-only),
deterministic lineage from every briefing number back to its source, and an operator-visible
difference between the production release and main. It would not build a new safety gate now. The
instruction itself:

> Proceed at full speed on the safe/inert work. I agree with the overall proposal, with the following decisions and refinements.
> 
> ## 1. Build the M7 Executive briefing evidence bundle now
> 
> APPROVED.
> 
> Build the deterministic typed evidence bundle specified by the existing M7 design.
> 
> The bundle becomes the **canonical evidence contract for the future Executive standard briefing**.
> 
> Important distinction:
> 
> **The evidence bundle is not business truth. It is the bounded evidence surface from which the briefing narrator is allowed to speak.**
> 
> The flow must be:
> 
> HQ/ERP read models
> → typed briefing evidence bundle
> → completeness/provenance/freshness validation
> → LLM narration
> 
> Each evidence item should carry, as applicable:
> 
> * metric/fact identifier
> * value
> * unit
> * business/brand scope
> * source reference
> * as-of timestamp
> * freshness information
> * deterministic derivation/provenance
> 
> The unsourced-number check must ensure that every numeric figure in the generated narrative can be traced to a bundle item.
> 
> The narrator must not introduce unsupported numbers.
> 
> A missing/stale/incomplete evidence bundle should produce an explicit degraded state rather than silently filling gaps.
> 
> Keep narration behind its existing feature flag and OFF.
> 
> Do not create the standard scheduled briefing job yet.
> 
> ## 2. Make the briefing task a real explicit capability contract
> 
> Do NOT implement TaskScope v2 heuristics for phrases such as:
> 
> * “what needs my attention”
> * “how did the group do”
> * “how current is the data”
> 
> Instead define an explicit Executive Briefing capability/skill contract whose trusted task produces the typed evidence bundle.
> 
> The normal user-facing natural-language question may map to that explicit capability, but the capability semantics must be deterministic.
> 
> This is the durable replacement for heuristic TaskScope expansion.
> 
> ## 3. Build generic Effective Execution Context now
> 
> APPROVED, and broaden the Ask HQ fix beyond M6.
> 
> Create one canonical execution-context resolution mechanism for every AI entry point.
> 
> At minimum distinguish:

> * requesting actor
> * enabling identity
> * acting identity
> * agent
> * business scope
> * brand scope
> * store/platform scope where applicable
> * environment
> * applicable permissions/policy/consent/capability readiness
> 
> The effective authority must be the **intersection**, never the union.
> 
> Conceptually:
> 
> requester
> ∩ enabling identity
> ∩ business/brand scope
> ∩ tool permission
> ∩ policy
> ∩ consent
> ∩ capability readiness
> 
> Do not let an enabling user grant the asker more authority than the asker possesses.
> 
> Do not let the asker escape the enabling user's authority.
> 
> A scheduled/system invocation must use the same canonical resolution path rather than getting a special bypass.
> 
> Add regression coverage for combinations such as:
> 
> * owner requester + restricted enabler
> * restricted requester + owner enabler
> * restricted requester + restricted enabler with different scopes
> * same permission but different business scopes
> * same business but different brand scopes
> * tool permission present only on one side
> * requester/enabler mismatch
> * no enabling identity
> 
> The resolved effective context must be auditable.
> 
> ## 4. Apply the same execution-context primitive to Ask HQ
> 
> M6 must no longer execute solely under the enabling user's reach.
> 
> The actual execution context must be narrowed to the effective intersection described above.
> 
> Do not create an M6-only authorization shortcut.
> 
> This is a shared control-plane primitive for future interactive, scheduled, delegated, and shadow execution.
> 
> ## 5. Build the autonomy evidence view now
> 
> Create a read-only operator view of autonomy evidence without changing autonomy grants.
> 
> It should make visible, per agent and relevant evaluation dimension:
> 
> * latest measured result
> * evidence count
> * agreement rate
> * required threshold
> * recent failures
> * unmeasured state
> * current autonomy ceiling
> * whether evidence satisfies the configured requirement
> * exact reason when it does not
> 
> Do not create or modify autonomy grants from this view.
> 
> This is evidence/observability infrastructure only.
> 
> ## 6. Add deterministic evidence lineage
> 
> For the M7 briefing bundle and the autonomy evidence view, preserve source lineage.
> 
> A number or evaluation metric should be traceable to:
> 
> source record
> → derived/read-model record
> → bundle/result
> → narrative or decision
> 
> Do not use opaque aggregation without retaining enough provenance to reconstruct how the value was obtained.
> 
> ## 7. Keep M6 inert
> 
> Continue building:
> 
> * Ask HQ

> The effective execution-context correction above must land before the M6 gate.
> 
> Do not enable `ask_hq`.
> 
> Do not enable `scheduler.nl`.
> 
> Do not create production model-driven automation.
> 
> ## 8. Continue Phase 3 inert work

## B. The plan (written before the code)

Four streams, one branch each, built in parallel in separate git worktrees with a separate test
database per worktree, each merged to main only on a full local verification recorded here as
"local verification passed; GitHub Actions validation deferred until the 1 October reset".

| Stream | Branch | Instruction points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Briefing evidence bundle, unsourced-number check, lineage, the explicit Executive Briefing contract | `m7/briefing-evidence-bundle` | 1, 2, 6 |
| B. Effective Execution Context, applied to Ask HQ, the scheduler and the shadow probes | `cp/effective-execution-context` | 3, 4, 7, 10, 14 (last line) |
| C. Autonomy evidence view, read-only, with lineage | `obs/autonomy-evidence-view` | 5, 6 |
| D. Production, main and unreleased state, read-only | `obs/release-state` | 16 |

Rules every stream keeps: no prompt file changes; nothing is switched on; no flag default changes to
on; no scheduled job is created; no autonomy grant is created or changed; historical evaluation rows
are never rewritten; a test is watched failing before the code that makes it pass, where the change
is a correction (stream B).

**A note on the executive stamp.** Stream B necessarily touches how a run's authority is resolved,
so it is the first change since `3314c54` that may touch `AgentRunner`. Gate 11 attempt 2 runs on the
production release `3314c54` and is not affected by main. The release that follows gate 11 will carry
stream B, so the shadow week would run on a runner gate 11 did not measure. That is reported to
ChatGPT in the end-of-milestone report as a sequencing question (release before the shadow opens and
re-measure, or open the shadow on `3314c54` and release after), not decided here.

## C. Record

(filled in per stream as it completes)

### C.3 Stream C: the autonomy evidence view (branch `obs/autonomy-evidence-view`, points 5 and 6)

**The plan, written before the code.**

*What was read first, and what it says about thresholds.* A required agreement rate exists in exactly
one place: on an autonomy grant (`autonomy_grants.min_agreement_rate`, optionally
`min_agreement_dimension` per ADR-030 and `evaluation_suite_key`). There is no table, config key or
ADR that sets a required rate per autonomy level or per dimension, and production holds zero grants.
A suite's `pass_threshold` (1.0 on the three seeded suites) is a different thing: it decides whether
one run of that suite passed, and it is shown as such. So today the honest reading of "required
threshold" for every agent and dimension is "no requirement configured", and the state is "not
eligible". The view invents no number; whether per-level requirements should exist is a decision for
Joy and ChatGPT and is listed in the record below.

*One service, pure query and arithmetic.* `App\Observe\Autonomy\AutonomyEvidence::build()` returns,
per agent, the resolver's present answer and one row for the overall rate plus one per evaluation
dimension. Rules, each deterministic:

1. **Applicable suites** are the ones the gate itself would run: active, and scoped to no role or to
   the agent's role (`role_key`, else the agent key, as `AgentEvaluationSubject` reads it).
2. **The latest-run rule.** Per applicable suite, the evidence is the finished run (`passed` or
   `failed`) with the highest id whose `agent_key` is this agent. Older runs are history and appear
   only under recent failures. A newer run that never finished is named as a caveat and is not
   evidence.
3. **Counted from result rows, never from a stored rate.** A row's figures are counted from
   `evaluation_results` of those runs with that dimension: passed, failed, unmeasured. Evidence count
   is passed plus failed; the agreement rate is passed over that, and null when nothing was measured.
   A provider-refused (`unmeasured`) result is in neither half. A result whose case belongs to
   another role is excluded. The stored `dimension_rates` of each run is shown beside the recount and
   a difference is reported, not hidden.
4. **No inheritance.** The overall row never supplies a dimension row. A dimension with no measured
   result reads "never measured", or "only unmeasured results" when the provider refused them all.
5. **Requirements** are the live grants (active, not expired) that name this agent or no agent and
   carry `min_agreement_rate`: a grant naming a dimension lands on that row, a grant naming none lands
   on the overall row, a grant naming a suite is checked against that suite's run only.
6. **Satisfied only when nothing is unknown.** A row is "not eligible" with every applicable reason
   listed: no requirement configured; never measured; the latest gate run failed (with its counts);
   the latest run had unmeasured cases; the run carries no prompt stamp, or a different stamp from
   the one `PromptLibrary` gives the agent today; the rate is below the required rate (checked
   against the pooled figure and against each contributing suite, so a strong suite cannot carry a
   weak one). "Satisfied" changes nothing: the resolver alone decides a level.
7. **The ceiling now** is the real `AutonomyResolver` asked the way `AgentRunner` asks it (agent key,
   environment, the agent's own ceiling, no business and no context), with its binding reason and
   constraints, beside the agent's status, the count of live grants and the `ai.runtime` flag.
8. **Lineage (point 6).** Every figure carries the run ids, run uuids, suite key, role scope, prompt
   stamp, model, date and the result ids it was counted from, and the page folds them under each
   figure.

*No write path.* One GET route, `/observe/autonomy-evidence`, behind `hq.agents.view` (the permission
AI health already uses, so no seeder change), a sidebar entry under Observe, the shared Observe
panels. No schema change. Flags are read from their rows, not through the cached reader, so the page
does not even write a cache entry.

*Tests.* The service directly: an unmeasured dimension does not inherit the overall rate;
other-role results and other agents' runs are excluded; an unmeasured result is neither pass nor
fail; the latest of several gate runs wins and an unfinished newer run is only a caveat; each reason
string; stamp mismatch; grant requirements per dimension, overall and per suite; viewing changes no
row (counts and `updated_at`). The page: GET only, the gates, which roles open it, and a query
listener proving a render issues no INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.
